<h1>The Best Movies According to Angel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />
<h3>Interstellar </h3>

<p>This movie is a piece of art in my opinion and basically predicted what a blackhole would look like before we even knew.</p>

<h3>White Men Can't Jump</h3>

<p>Hilarious basketball movie and the reboot was really good as well.</p>

<h3>The Core</h3>

<p>Really cool sci-fi movie which depicts an apocolyptic scenario where the core stops spinning.</p>
